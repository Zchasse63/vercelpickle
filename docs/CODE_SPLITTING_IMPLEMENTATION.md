# Code Splitting Implementation

This document explains the code splitting strategies implemented in the Pickle B2B Marketplace application and their expected performance impact.

## 1. Dashboard Feature Code Splitting

### Before: Monolithic Dashboard Component

Previously, the `AdminFinancialDashboard` component was imported directly, causing it to be included in the main bundle:

```jsx
import { AdminFinancialDashboard } from "@/components/admin/admin-financial-dashboard"

export default function AdminDashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <AdminFinancialDashboard />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This approach had several drawbacks:
- The large dashboard component (403 lines) was included in the initial bundle, even if the user never visited the admin dashboard.
- All dependencies of the dashboard component (date-fns, chart libraries, etc.) were also included in the initial bundle.
- The dashboard component was rendered server-side, which is unnecessary for interactive charts and can cause hydration issues.

### After: Lazy-Loaded Dashboard Component

We've implemented code splitting for the dashboard component using Next.js's dynamic imports:

```jsx
// components/admin/lazy-admin-financial-dashboard.tsx
"use client"

import dynamic from "next/dynamic"
import { AdminFinancialDashboardSkeleton } from "./admin-financial-dashboard-skeleton"

// Dynamically import the AdminFinancialDashboard component
const AdminFinancialDashboard = dynamic(
  () => import("./admin-financial-dashboard").then(mod => ({ default: mod.AdminFinancialDashboard })),
  {
    loading: () => <AdminFinancialDashboardSkeleton />,
    ssr: false // Disable SSR for this component since it contains charts
  }
)

export function LazyAdminFinancialDashboard() {
  return <AdminFinancialDashboard />
}
```

And in the page component:

```jsx
import { LazyAdminFinancialDashboard } from "@/components/admin/lazy-admin-financial-dashboard"

export default function AdminDashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <LazyAdminFinancialDashboard />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This approach has several benefits:
- The dashboard component is only loaded when needed, reducing the initial bundle size.
- A skeleton loader is shown while the component is loading, providing a better user experience.
- The component is client-side rendered, avoiding potential hydration issues with interactive charts.

## 2. Chart Component Code Splitting

### Before: Directly Imported Chart Component

Previously, the `AdminSalesChart` component was imported directly:

```jsx
import { AdminSalesChart } from "@/components/admin/admin-sales-chart"

export function SalesSection() {
  return (
    <div className="h-[300px]">
      <AdminSalesChart />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This approach had several drawbacks:
- The chart component and its dependencies (recharts library) were included in the initial bundle.
- Chart libraries are typically large and can significantly increase the bundle size.
- The chart component was rendered server-side, which can cause hydration issues.

### After: Lazy-Loaded Chart Component

We've implemented code splitting for the chart component:

```jsx
// components/admin/lazy-admin-sales-chart.tsx
"use client"

import dynamic from "next/dynamic"
import { AdminSalesChartSkeleton } from "./admin-sales-chart-skeleton"

// Dynamically import the AdminSalesChart component
const AdminSalesChart = dynamic(
  () => import("./admin-sales-chart").then(mod => ({ default: mod.AdminSalesChart })),
  {
    loading: () => <AdminSalesChartSkeleton />,
    ssr: false // Disable SSR for this component since it's a chart
  }
)

export function LazyAdminSalesChart() {
  return <AdminSalesChart />
}
```

And in the component that uses it:

```jsx
import { LazyAdminSalesChart } from "@/components/admin/lazy-admin-sales-chart"

export function SalesSection() {
  return (
    <div className="h-[300px]">
      <LazyAdminSalesChart />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This approach has several benefits:
- The chart component and its dependencies are only loaded when needed.
- A skeleton loader is shown while the chart is loading, providing a better user experience.
- The chart is client-side rendered, avoiding potential hydration issues.

## 3. Skeleton Loaders

We've implemented skeleton loaders for both components to provide a better user experience during loading:

### Dashboard Skeleton

```jsx
// components/admin/admin-financial-dashboard-skeleton.tsx
import { Skeleton } from "@/components/ui/skeleton"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
  Tabs,
  TabsList,
  TabsTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui-kit"

export function AdminFinancialDashboardSkeleton() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Skeleton structure that matches the dashboard layout */}
      <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-start md:items-center gap-4">
        <div>
          <Skeleton className="h-8 w-64 mb-2" />
          <Skeleton className="h-4 w-96" />
        </div>
        {/* More skeleton elements... */}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Chart Skeleton

```jsx
// components/admin/admin-sales-chart-skeleton.tsx
import { Skeleton } from "@/components/ui/skeleton"

export function AdminSalesChartSkeleton() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full min-h-[300px]">
      <Skeleton className="w-full h-full min-h-[300px] rounded-md" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Expected Performance Impact

### Bundle Size Reduction

By implementing code splitting for these components, we expect to see a significant reduction in the initial bundle size:

| Component | Approximate Size | Dependencies | Total Size Reduction |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| AdminFinancialDashboard | ~50KB | date-fns, lucide-react | ~100KB |
| AdminSalesChart | ~10KB | recharts | ~150KB |

### Improved Initial Load Time

With a smaller initial bundle, we expect to see improvements in several key metrics:

| Metric | Expected Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|
| Time to First Byte (TTFB) | No change (server-side) |
| First Contentful Paint (FCP) | 10-15% faster |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 15-20% faster |
| Time to Interactive (TTI) | 20-25% faster |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT) | 30-40% reduction |

### Better User Experience

The implementation of skeleton loaders provides a better user experience during loading:

- Users see a visual representation of the content structure immediately.
- The page appears more responsive, even while content is loading.
- The transition from skeleton to actual content is smooth and predictable.

## Measuring the Impact

To measure the impact of these code splitting optimizations, we can use the bundle analyzer:

1. **Before Optimization**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:analyze
   ```
   This will generate a report showing the bundle size before optimization.

2. **After Optimization**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:analyze
   ```
   This will generate a report showing the bundle size after optimization.

3. **Compare Reports**:
   - Look for the reduction in the main bundle size.
   - Verify that the dashboard and chart components are now in separate chunks.
   - Check that the chart library dependencies are only included in the chart chunk.

## Best Practices for Code Splitting

1. **Identify Large Components**:
   - Use the bundle analyzer to identify large components.
   - Focus on components that aren't needed for the initial render.

2. **Create Meaningful Skeleton Loaders**:
   - Design skeleton loaders that match the structure of the actual component.
   - Use the same spacing and layout to minimize layout shifts.

3. **Use Dynamic Imports Strategically**:
   - Apply dynamic imports to components that are:
     - Large in size
     - Not needed for the initial render
     - Used only in specific routes or user flows

4. **Disable SSR for Client-Heavy Components**:
   - Set `ssr: false` for components that:
     - Contain charts or other browser-specific features
     - Rely heavily on client-side APIs
     - May cause hydration issues

5. **Monitor Performance Metrics**:
   - Regularly check Core Web Vitals to ensure optimizations are effective.
   - Use Lighthouse to identify additional optimization opportunities.

By following these best practices and implementing code splitting for large components, we can significantly improve the performance of the Pickle B2B Marketplace application.
