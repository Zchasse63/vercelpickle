## Overview

The Pickle B2B Marketplace consists of a Next.js frontend and a backend API service. This guide outlines the steps to integrate these components to create a cohesive application.

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router, Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Convex for real-time database and backend logic
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management
- **Authentication**: Convex authentication with role-based access control

## Authentication Integration

### Current Status

- Authentication has been fully implemented with Convex
- User authentication state is managed by the AuthStore
- Protected routes are implemented for buyer, seller, and admin dashboards
- Session persistence is implemented with localStorage

### Implementation Details

1. **Authentication Store**:
   - The `AuthStore` manages authentication state using Zustand
   - Authentication state is persisted to localStorage
   - The store provides methods for login, registration, and logout
   - User information is synchronized with the backend

2. **Authentication Provider**:
   - The `AuthProvider` component provides authentication context to the application
   - It handles authentication state changes and synchronizes with the AuthStore
   - It provides user information and authentication status to components

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Route guards are implemented for protected pages
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
   - Role-based access control is implemented for buyer, seller, and admin routes

4. **Session Management**:
   - Authentication tokens are stored securely in localStorage
   - Session persistence is implemented with Zustand's persist middleware
   - Token refresh is handled automatically by Convex

## API Integration

### Current Status

- Convex API integration has been fully implemented
- Data Access Layer (DAL) provides a centralized interface for interacting with Convex
- Loading states and error handling are implemented consistently
- Real-time data synchronization is implemented with Convex's real-time capabilities

### Implementation Details

1. **Data Access Layer**:
   - The Data Access Layer provides a centralized interface for interacting with Convex
   - It implements consistent patterns for data fetching, error handling, and state management
   - All Convex queries and mutations are accessed through this layer

2. **Enhanced Convex Hooks**:
   - Enhanced versions of Convex's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks are implemented
   - These hooks provide consistent loading, error, and success states
   - They handle error reporting and notifications automatically

3. **Real-time Data Synchronization**:
   - Convex's real-time capabilities are used for automatic data synchronization
   - Components automatically re-render when data changes
   - Optimistic updates are implemented for better UX

4. **Type Safety**:
   - All data structures are fully typed with TypeScript
   - Convex's generated types are used for type safety
   - Custom type utilities are implemented for enhanced type safety

## Data Flow

### Current Status

- Components are using local state or mock data
- No centralized state management

### Integration Steps

1. **Define Data Models**:
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for all data models
   - Ensure consistency between frontend and backend models
   - Implement validation for form inputs

2. **Implement Data Transformation**:
   - Create utility functions to transform API responses to frontend models
   - Handle date formatting and other data normalization

3. **Optimize Data Loading**:
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Add infinite scrolling where appropriate
   - Implement data prefetching for common user flows

## State Management

### Current Status

- Zustand is used for global state management
- Stores are implemented for authentication, cart, addresses, payment methods, orders, and theme
- State is persisted to localStorage for a seamless user experience
- State is synchronized with the backend when the user is authenticated

### Implementation Details

1. **Store Structure**:
   - Each domain has its own store with specific state and methods
   - The `AuthStore` manages authentication state
   - The `CartStore` manages shopping cart state
   - The `AddressStore` manages shipping address state
   - The `PaymentStore` manages payment method state
   - The `OrderStore` manages order and checkout state
   - The `ThemeStore` manages theme preferences

2. **Store Synchronization**:
   - The `StoreInitializer` component synchronizes all stores with the backend
   - It is included in the `StoreProvider` component to ensure all stores are synchronized automatically
   - It checks authentication on mount and synchronizes stores when the user changes

3. **Persistence**:
   - State is persisted to localStorage using Zustand's persist middleware
   - This ensures a seamless user experience across page reloads
   - Sensitive data is not persisted to localStorage

4. **Error Handling**:
   - All stores use the same pattern for error handling
   - Errors are handled consistently with user-friendly notifications
   - Loading states are managed consistently across all stores

## Error Handling

### Current Status

- Comprehensive error handling and notification system has been implemented
- Centralized error handling utilities are used across the application
- Form validation is implemented with Zod schemas
- Error boundaries are implemented for catching rendering errors

### Implementation Details

1. **Centralized Error Handling**:
   - The `handleError` and `handleStoreError` functions provide centralized error handling
   - They log errors to the console and display user-friendly notifications
   - They are used consistently across the application

2. **Loading and Error State Handlers**:
   - The `createLoadingHandler` and `createErrorHandler` functions provide consistent loading and error state management
   - They are used in all stores and components that perform asynchronous operations
   - They ensure consistent loading and error state management

3. **Notification System**:
   - The `showSuccessNotification` and `showErrorNotification` functions provide user-friendly notifications
   - They are used to provide feedback to users after operations
   - They ensure consistent notification styling and behavior

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Zod schemas are used for form validation
   - The `useZodForm` hook provides a consistent interface for form validation
   - Form errors are displayed with clear error messages

## Testing

### Current Status

- Unit tests for UI components
- No integration tests for API calls

### Integration Steps

1. **Implement Integration Tests**:
   - Create tests for API integration
   - Test authentication flows
   - Test error handling

2. **Mock API Responses**:
   - Create mock API responses for testing
   - Test different response scenarios (success, error, loading)

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Test authentication, product browsing, and checkout

## Deployment

### Current Status

- Frontend deployment configured
- Backend deployment pending integration

### Integration Steps

   - Implement database migrations

3. **Staging Environment**:
   - Set up a staging environment for testing
