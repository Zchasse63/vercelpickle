# UI Component Enhancements and Test Routing Investigation

## 1. Routing Issues Investigation

### Findings

1. **Route Configuration**: The routes `/buyer/settings`, `/buyer/shipping`, and `/buyer/payment-methods` exist in the Next.js app, but there are issues with how the tests are navigating to these routes.

2. **Component Structure Mismatch**: The tests are looking for elements directly, but they're nested inside tabs and cards. For example, the BuyerProfileSettings component is rendered inside a Card in the settings page.

3. **Button Text Mismatch**: The tests are looking for buttons with specific text (e.g., "Edit Profile") but the button text might be different or the buttons might not have the expected data-testid attributes.

4. **Form Structure**: The form structure in the tests doesn't match the actual component structure. For example, the tests are looking for a single name field, but the component has firstName and lastName fields.

5. **Test Setup**: The tests are using `setupBuyerTest` to mock the API responses, but there might be issues with how the mocks are being applied.

### Actions Taken

1. **Added Debug Logging**: Added console logging to the tests to track the navigation flow and identify where the tests are failing.

2. **Created Debug Script**: Created a script to check the Next.js routes and verify that the required routes exist.

3. **Verified Routes**: Confirmed that the routes `/buyer/settings`, `/buyer/shipping`, and `/buyer/payment-methods` exist in the Next.js app.

4. **Analyzed Component Structure**: Examined the component structure to identify where the tests are failing to find elements.

   - Tests are looking for specific button text that doesn't match the actual text
   - Tests are navigating to pages but not finding the expected elements

2. **Component Structure**:
   - The component structure doesn't match what the tests are expecting
   - The tests are looking for elements directly, but they're nested inside tabs and cards
