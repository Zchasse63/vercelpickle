# Bundle Analysis Report

This document provides an analysis of the Pickle B2B Marketplace application's bundle sizes and recommendations for optimization.

## Setup

We've configured bundle analysis for the Pickle B2B Marketplace using `@next/bundle-analyzer`. This tool generates visual reports of bundle sizes, helping us identify large dependencies and optimization opportunities.

### Configuration

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer
   ```

2. **Next.js Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   // next.config.mjs
   import { createRequire } from 'module';
   const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

   // Import the bundle analyzer
   const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
     enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
   });

   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     // ... other config options
   }

   export default withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig)
   ```

3. **NPM Script**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build:analyze": "ANALYZE=true next build"
   }
   ```

## Analysis Findings

Based on the bundle analysis reports, we've identified several areas for optimization:

### 1. Large Dependencies

The following dependencies contribute significantly to the bundle size:

- **UI Component Libraries**: The Radix UI components collectively add substantial weight to the bundle.
- **Chart Libraries**: Both Chart.js and Recharts are included, which is redundant.
- **Animation Libraries**: Framer Motion adds significant weight to the bundle.
- **Form Libraries**: React Hook Form and its dependencies add to the bundle size.

### 2. Code Splitting Opportunities

Several components and pages could benefit from additional code splitting:

- **Dashboard Components**: Admin, Seller, and Buyer dashboard components could be further split.
- **Chart Components**: Chart components should be lazy-loaded only when needed.
- **Form Components**: Complex form components could be lazy-loaded.

### 3. Duplicate Code

There appears to be some duplication in the bundle:

- **Utility Functions**: Some utility functions are duplicated across multiple bundles.
- **Component Styles**: Some component styles are duplicated.

## Optimization Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following optimizations:

### 1. Optimize Dependencies

1. **Consolidate Chart Libraries**:
   - Choose either Chart.js or Recharts, not both.
   - Recommendation: Stick with Chart.js as it's more widely used and has better documentation.

   ```javascript
   // Remove from package.json
   "recharts": "latest",
   ```

2. **Optimize UI Component Imports**:
   - Import only the specific Radix UI components that are needed, not the entire library.
   - Use tree-shaking to eliminate unused components.

   ```javascript
   // Instead of
   import * as RadixUI from '@radix-ui/react-components';
   
   // Use
   import { Dialog } from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';
   import { Tabs } from '@radix-ui/react-tabs';
   ```

3. **Optimize Animation Library**:
   - Consider using CSS animations for simple animations instead of Framer Motion.
   - Lazy-load Framer Motion only for pages that need complex animations.

   ```javascript
   // Lazy load Framer Motion
   const MotionComponent = dynamic(() => import('./motion-component'), {
     ssr: false,
   });
   ```

### 2. Implement Additional Code Splitting

1. **Dashboard Features**:
   - Split dashboard features into separate chunks that are loaded only when needed.

   ```javascript
   // Lazy load dashboard features
   const AdminAnalytics = dynamic(() => import('@/components/admin/admin-analytics'), {
     loading: () => <AnalyticsSkeleton />,
   });
   ```

2. **Chart Components**:
   - Lazy-load all chart components.

   ```javascript
   // Lazy load chart components
   const SalesChart = dynamic(() => import('@/components/charts/sales-chart'), {
     loading: () => <ChartSkeleton />,
   });
   ```

3. **Form Components**:
   - Lazy-load complex form components.

   ```javascript
   // Lazy load complex form components
   const AdvancedFilterForm = dynamic(() => import('@/components/forms/advanced-filter-form'), {
     loading: () => <FormSkeleton />,
   });
   ```

### 3. Optimize Images

1. **Implement Responsive Images**:
   - Use the Next.js Image component with proper sizing and formats.
   - Implement blur placeholders for images.

   ```javascript
   <Image
     src={product.image}
     alt={product.name}
     width={300}
     height={300}
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
     placeholder="blur"
     blurDataURL={product.blurDataURL}
   />
   ```

2. **Optimize Image Formats**:
   - Use WebP or AVIF formats for better compression.
   - Implement a CDN for image delivery.

### 4. Implement Tree Shaking

1. **Configure Webpack for Better Tree Shaking**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies are properly tree-shakable.
   - Use ES modules and named exports.

2. **Avoid Side Effects**:
   - Mark packages as side-effect-free when possible.
   - Avoid side effects in module scope.

### 5. Implement Dynamic Imports for Large Dependencies

1. **Dynamically Import Large Libraries**:
   - Use dynamic imports for large libraries that aren't needed immediately.

   ```javascript
   // Instead of
   import { Chart } from 'chart.js';
   
   // Use
   const Chart = dynamic(() => import('chart.js').then(mod => mod.Chart), {
     ssr: false,
   });
   ```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Dependency Optimization**
   - Remove redundant chart library
   - Optimize UI component imports
   - Lazy-load animation library

2. **Phase 2: Additional Code Splitting**
   - Implement code splitting for dashboard features
   - Lazy-load chart components
   - Lazy-load complex form components

3. **Phase 3: Image Optimization**
   - Implement responsive images
   - Optimize image formats
   - Consider using a CDN

4. **Phase 4: Tree Shaking and Dynamic Imports**
   - Configure webpack for better tree shaking
   - Implement dynamic imports for large dependencies

## Conclusion

By implementing these optimizations, we expect to significantly reduce the bundle size of the Pickle B2B Marketplace application, resulting in faster load times and better performance for users. The most impactful changes will be consolidating chart libraries, optimizing UI component imports, and implementing additional code splitting for large features.

Regular bundle analysis should be performed after implementing these optimizations to measure their impact and identify additional optimization opportunities.
