## Implementation Plan

To implement these improvements systematically, follow this approach:

1. **Start with High Priority Tasks**: Begin with the most critical improvements that will have the biggest impact.
2. **Group Related Tasks**: Work on related tasks together to maintain context and efficiency.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: After each improvement, test thoroughly to ensure no regressions.
4. **Document Changes**: Update documentation to reflect the changes made.
5. **Measure Impact**: Use performance metrics to measure the impact of each improvement.

## Measuring Success

Success should be measured using the following metrics:

1. **Bundle Size**: Reduction in initial and overall bundle size.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Improvements in Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).
3. **Code Quality**: Reduction in technical debt and improved maintainability.
4. **Developer Experience**: Improved developer experience and productivity.
5. **User Experience**: Smoother user experience with fewer loading states and errors.

By systematically implementing these improvements, the Pickle B2B Marketplace application will become more performant, maintainable, and user-friendly.
