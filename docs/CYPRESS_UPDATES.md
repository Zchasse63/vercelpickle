# Cypress Testing Updates

**Date:** 2025-05-10

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent updates to the Cypress testing framework for the Pickle B2B Marketplace project. The updates focus on enhancing the test coverage and improving the test structure for better maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Test Structure

- **Organized tests by user role**:
  - `guest-user.cy.ts`: Tests for unauthenticated users
  - `buyer-user.cy.ts`: Tests for authenticated buyers
  - `seller-user.cy.ts`: Tests for authenticated sellers
  - `admin-user.cy.ts`: Tests for authenticated admins
  - `marketplace.cy.ts`: Tests for marketplace functionality

### 2. Comprehensive Test Scenarios

- **Guest User Tests**:
  - Home page elements and navigation
  - Marketplace navigation and filtering
  - Product details and cart functionality
  - Authentication forms and validation
  - About page content

- **Seller User Tests**:
  - Authentication and logout
  - Dashboard navigation
  - Product management (CRUD operations)
  - Order management
  - Analytics dashboard
  - Profile management

- **Admin User Tests**:
  - Authentication and logout
  - Dashboard navigation
  - User management
  - Product management
  - Order management
  - Analytics dashboard
  - Settings management

### 3. Test Data

- **Fixture Files**:
  - `users.json`: Test user data for different roles
  - `products.json`: Test product data with detailed specifications
  - `orders.json`: Test order data with items, shipping, and payment details
  - `categories.json`: Test category data with subcategories

### 4. Custom Commands

- Added `getByTestId` command for better element selection
- Enhanced existing commands for common actions:
  - `login`: Login with email and password
  - `addToCart`: Add a product to cart
  - `completeCheckout`: Complete the checkout process
  - `filterProducts`: Filter products by criteria
  - `createTestProduct`: Create a test product (for seller)

### 5. Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - `CYPRESS_TESTING.md`: Detailed guide to the testing strategy
  - `CYPRESS_UPDATES.md`: Summary of recent updates (this document)

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Describe blocks** for major features or pages
2. **beforeEach hooks** for setup (login, navigation)
3. **it blocks** for specific test cases
4. **Assertions** to verify expected behavior

### Element Selection Strategy

Tests use a consistent element selection strategy:

1. **data-testid attributes** for reliable element selection
   ```html
   <button data-testid="add-to-cart-button">Add to Cart</button>
   ```

2. **Custom getByTestId command** for cleaner test code
   ```typescript
   cy.getByTestId('add-to-cart-button').click();
   ```

### Test Data Management

Tests use fixture files for test data:

```typescript
cy.fixture('users.json').then((users) => {
  cy.login(users.sellers[0].email, users.sellers[0].password);
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add data-testid attributes** to all components in the application
2. **Implement component testing** for UI components
3. **Add visual regression tests** for critical UI components
4. **Integrate with CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing
5. **Add performance and accessibility tests** for critical user flows
