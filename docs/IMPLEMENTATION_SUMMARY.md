## 4. Remaining Issues and Limitations

- Some form validation tests are still failing due to the test environment setup
- Visual testing requires further configuration for optimal results
- Accessibility testing needs to be expanded to cover more scenarios
- Error handling for network errors could be improved

## 5. Next Steps
