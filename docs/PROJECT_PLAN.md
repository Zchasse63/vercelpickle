# Pickle B2B Marketplace - Project Plan

**Last Updated:** `2023-05-11`

> **Note**: This document provides a detailed project plan and timeline for the Pickle B2B Marketplace project. For more detailed information, see the [Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).

## Project Overview

Pickle is a specialized B2B food marketplace platform acting as a broker between food distributors with overstock or close-to-date products and other distributors/wholesalers looking to purchase these items at discounted rates. The platform takes a 5% fee on transactions, facilitating one-time sales rather than recurring orders. Pickle aims to help distributors liquidate dead stock, specialized products, or items that would otherwise go to waste, while providing buyers with opportunities to purchase quality products at competitive prices.
