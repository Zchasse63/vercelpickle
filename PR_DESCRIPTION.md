- Created rules for import order, component naming, component structure, hook usage, accessibility, and performance
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/ESLINT_CUSTOM_RULES.md`

### Medium Priority

#### Component Test Factory
- Created a comprehensive test factory system for generating tests for similar components
- Implemented specialized factories for different component types (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Added a test generation script for creating test files from component files
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/COMPONENT_TEST_FACTORY.md`

#### Component Composition System
- Implemented a powerful and flexible system for composing complex components from simpler ones
- Created pre-defined patterns for common composition scenarios
- Added utilities for working with composed components
- Integrated with the existing Component Factory Pattern
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/COMPONENT_COMPOSITION_SYSTEM.md`

### Low Priority

#### Jest Snapshot Testing Enhancement
- Implemented enhanced snapshot testing capabilities
- Created a custom snapshot serializer for capturing DOM structure, styling, and accessibility attributes
- Added specialized functions for testing component variants, sizes, states, responsive behavior, and accessibility
- Integrated with the Component Factory Pattern and Component Composition System
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/SNAPSHOT_TESTING.md`

## Implementation Details

### ESLint Custom Rules
- Created custom rules in `eslint/rules/`
- Added configuration in `.eslintrc.js`
- Implemented automated tests for each rule
- Created a plugin system for easy extension

### Component Test Factory
- Created core factory in `lib/test-factory.tsx`
- Implemented specialized factories in `lib/test-factory-specialized.tsx`
- Added test generation script in `scripts/generate-component-tests.js`
- Created comprehensive tests in `lib/__tests__/test-factory.test.tsx`

### Component Composition System
- Created core composition system in `lib/component-composition.tsx`
- Implemented composition patterns in `lib/composition-patterns.tsx`
- Added composition utilities in `lib/composition-utils.tsx`
- Created factory integration in `lib/component-composition-factory.tsx`
- Added example components in `components/ui/composed-form-field.tsx` and `components/ui/composed-product-card.tsx`
- Created comprehensive tests in `lib/__tests__/component-composition.test.tsx`

### Jest Snapshot Testing Enhancement
- Created core snapshot utilities in `lib/snapshot-testing.tsx`
- Implemented specialized functions in `lib/snapshot-testing-specialized.tsx`
- Added factory integration in `lib/snapshot-testing-factory.tsx`
- Created comprehensive tests in `lib/__tests__/snapshot-testing.test.tsx`
- Added example tests in `components/ui/__tests__/factory-button.snapshot.test.tsx`

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation for each feature
- Updated README.md with information about the new tools and patterns
- Created a final implementation report in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- Updated PROGRESS.md to track completion of all tasks

## Testing

All tests are passing, including:
- Unit tests for all new features
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Snapshot tests for UI components

## Performance Improvements

The refactoring has resulted in significant performance improvements:
- Reduced bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading
- Improved rendering performance through memoization and optimized event handlers
- Enhanced developer experience through better tooling and documentation

## Next Steps

After merging this PR, the next steps should focus on:
1. Implementing backend integration features (user profile management, product management, analytics dashboard)
2. Further optimizing performance
3. Enhancing the user experience
